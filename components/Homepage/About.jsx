          My name is Mzukisi Gaju. Born in South Africa, in a city called Port
          Elizabeth/Gqeberha. This is where I am currently based. I have always
          had an interest in photography, ever since I owned my first phone with
          a camera. I always had an obsession with taking pictures of the
          sunset, especially in the in West Coast, Saldanha - primarily that is
          where the sun sets on the beach - one of the best sunsets around. It
          was a walk away to the beach from where I was staying and I would take
          those sunset bangers using my phone camera, but inside wishing, if
          only I had owned a proper camera for such beautiful moments. So that
          is in a nutshell how my love for sunsets began. My work is an
          obsession, so whenever I hold my camera, every shoot is an opportunity
          to learn and to further develop my craft - discovering more about
          myself and what fascinates me more in photography.

          My portfolio showcases some favorite images; I strive to create
          photographs that not only capture a moment, but also capture a feeling
          and essence. I am available for portraits, groups/family, weddings,
          engagements, matric farewells and business events sessions. Prints of
          my personal work are also available. Iâ€™d love to hear from you, so
          feel free to contact me. Thank you for taking time to look at my site
          and work; I hope to meet you in the near future.
